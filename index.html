<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ABOUT</h1>

<p>There's a very good tool at <a href="http://airlea.nl/kwrt/">http://airlea.nl/kwrt/</a>, which allow players to save
their replays semi-automatically. However, I've decided to write my own tool
since even the semi-automatic feature doesn't work for me.</p>

<h1>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INSTALLATION</h1>

<p>Grab the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/forcecore/KWReplayAutoSaver/releases">https://github.com/forcecore/KWReplayAutoSaver/releases</a>.
Simply unzip the files to any folder of your choice and run autosaver.exe.
The application will run in tray and watch for any changes of the last replay.
At the first run, it will ask for the "Last Replay.KWReplay", which has
variable names depending on the language settings of the game you installed.</p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>USAGE</h1>

<p>This replay saver will monitor the last replay and create a copy of it it when
the program thinks it saw a change to the last replay. This copying can
occur a few times during a match, which is probably the reason why KWRT
chose to go for semi-automatic method, rather than fully automatic method.
(But don't worry, you'll get only one replay from one game!)</p>

<p>The new name for the replay will contain the time stamp and some of the
player information (one of the players who isn't you, you know that you are
playing!), e.g, "2014-10-11T1653 vs BoolBada".
You can choose not to have player info by right clicking on the tray icon and
unchecking the option.</p>

<p>Double clicking or selecting "Open replay manager" tray menu will launch
replay manager application. Like the KWRT, it can read many informations
from the replay file without launching the game.
In addition, it has many features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rename with time stamp, (like KWRT) by right clicking on the replays list.</li>
<li>Modify/embed description into the replay.</li>
<li>Search replays by player, map, description or replay file name.</li>
<li>Supports UTF-8. No more unreadable information!</li>
</ul>
