{"name":"KWRAS - Kane's Wrath Replay Auto Saver","tagline":"Automatically saves the last replays of Kane's Wrath while the game is running","body":"# ABOUT\r\nThere's a very good tool at http://airlea.nl/kwrt/, which allow players to save\r\ntheir replays semi-automatically. However, I've decided to write my own tool\r\nsince even the semi-automatic feature doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\n# INSTALLATION\r\nGrab the latest release from https://github.com/forcecore/KWReplayAutoSaver/releases.\r\nSimply unzip the files to any folder of your choice and run autosaver.exe.\r\nThe application will run in tray and watch for any changes of the last replay.\r\nAt the first run, it will ask for the \"Last Replay.KWReplay\", which has\r\nvariable names depending on the language settings of the game you installed.\r\n\r\n# USAGE\r\nThis replay saver will monitor the last replay and create a copy of it it when\r\nthe program thinks it saw a change to the last replay. This copying can\r\noccur a few times during a match, which is probably the reason why KWRT\r\nchose to go for semi-automatic method, rather than fully automatic method.\r\n(But don't worry, you'll get only one replay from one game!)\r\n\r\nThe new name for the replay will contain the time stamp and some of the\r\nplayer information (one of the players who isn't you, you know that you are\r\nplaying!), e.g, \"2014-10-11T1653 vs BoolBada\".\r\nYou can choose not to have player info by right clicking on the tray icon and\r\nunchecking the option.\r\n\r\nDouble clicking or selecting \"Open replay manager\" tray menu will launch\r\nreplay manager application. Like the KWRT, it can read many informations\r\nfrom the replay file without launching the game.\r\nIn addition, it has many features such as:\r\n* Rename with time stamp, (like KWRT) by right clicking on the replays list.\r\n* Modify/embed description into the replay.\r\n* Search replays by player, map, description or replay file name.\r\n* Supports UTF-8. No more unreadable information!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe releases and the sourcodes are available at:\r\nhttps://github.com/forcecore/KWReplayAutoSaver\r\n\r\nThe replay format is credited to R Schneider:\r\nhttp://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=706067&st=0&p=7863248&#entry7863248","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
