Kane's Wrath Replay Auto Saver
by BoolBada, ssanzing@gmail.com

There's a very good tool at http://airlea.nl/kwrt/, which allow players to save
their replays semi-automatically. However, I've decided to write my own tool
since even the semi-automatic feature doesn't work for me.



INSTALLATION

Simply unzip the files to any folder of your choice and run autosaver.exe.
The application will run in tray and watch for any changes of the last replay.
At the first run, it will ask for the "Last Replay.KWReplay", which has
variable names depending on the language settings of the game you installed.



USAGE

This replay saver will monitor the last replay and create a copy of it it when
the program thinks it saw a change to the last replay. This copying can
occur a few times during a match, which is probably the reason why KWRT
chose to go for semi-automatic method, rather than fully automatic method.
(But don't worry, you'll get only one replay from one game!)

The new name for the replay will contain the time stamp and some of the
player information (one of the players who isn't you, you know that you are
playing!), e.g, "2014-10-11T1653 vs BoolBada".
You can choose not to have player info by right click on the tray icon and
unchecking the option.
