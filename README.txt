Kane's Wrath Replay Auto Saver
by BoolBada, ssanzing@gmail.com

There's a very good tool at http://airlea.nl/kwrt/, which allow players to save their replays
semi-automatically. However, I've decided to write my own tool since even the semi-automatic
feature doesn't work for me.

Simply unzip the files to any folder of your choice and run autosaver.exe.
At the first run, it will ask for the "Last Replay.KWReplay", which has variable names
depending on the language settings of the game you installed.

The releases and the sourcodes are available at:
